description: The Madrasa of Ulugh Beg in Samarqand (1417-20). Standing in front of
  the Registan square, this four-iwan madrasa has four domed chambers on the corners,
  possibly functioning as mausolea, and a vaulted prayer hall on the iwan axis. The
  Registan square was defined later by the addition of two other madrasas to form
  a locus of urban life.
